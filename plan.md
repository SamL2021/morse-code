// Challenge Morse Code Project

// Create a user interface that allows the user to either input some English text or some Morse Code
// You should also write tests for all of your functions before you begin
// Create JS functions that would allow the user to translate their English text into Morse Code or Morse Code into English text
// Make sure to handle spaces properly (ie. there is 1 space between English words, but one space between Morse Code characters)
// Don't write tests for DOM interaction
// Due Friday 10th
